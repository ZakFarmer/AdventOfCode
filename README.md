# AdventOfCode
My solutions for Advent Of Code 2022.

Written in Rust.

I've chosen not to use Cargo and organise common code into subcrates etc. so every .rs file is compilable with rustc.
For example, day two's solution (part one) can be compiled by running: `rustc day_two/part_one/day_two.rs`

I might go with a proper Cargo workspace later on as the problems get more complex. Unit testing will also be a lot more prevalent later on.
